  description: |
    hwinfo/libhd are used to probe for the hardware present in the system. It
    can be used to generate a system overview log which can be later used for
    support.

    This project provides a hardware probing library libhd.so and a command
    line tool hwinfo using it. A major project using this library is YaST, the
    SUSE installation tool.
